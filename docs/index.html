<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment, we were asked to achieve a software
  rasterizer including features such as drawing triangles, 
  supersampling, hierarchical transforms, and texture mapping 
  with antialiasing. 
  I have achieved the following tasks:

    <li>Task 1: Drawing single-color triangles</li>
    <li>Task 2: Antialiasing by supersampling</li>
    <li>Task 3: Transformations</li>
    <li>Task 4: Barycentric color interpolation</li>
    <li>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mappingexture mapping</li>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Drawing single-color triangles</h3>


<p>
  In this task, I have achieved basic rasterization methods for single-color triangles.
  
  For this part, the basic procedures to rasterize a triangle with a single color are: defining the rotation of the vertices (i.e., a -> b -> c), generating a bounding box for the triangle, performing in-triangle test and setting the given color for each pixel in the triangle.

  The achieved basic implementation is exactly that checks each sample within the bounding box.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>
  In this part, I have achieved basic supersampling techniques to reduce the aliasing effects in the rasterized images.
  
  The basic algorithm for this part is simple. Suppose we have a target image with the size of width x height. The data structure for the implemented algorithm is to simply allocate a larger sample buffer, i.e.,  
  <pre><code>
    std::vector&ltColor&gt sample_buffer(sample_rate * (width * height));
  </code></pre>
  Each "big" sampled pixel is divided into a square with length of <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> with number of <code>sample_rate</code> "sub" supersample "small" pixels.

  The different triangle rasterization processes are performed on this 1d <code>sample_buffer</code>. For each frame, when the rasterization ends, the method 
  <pre><code>
    RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer()
  </code></pre>
  will be called. In this method, the 2D average filter is applied to the "enlarged" sample buffer. For each supersampling group (i.e., the square area), this method will calculate a averaged color information based on the "sub" pixels in this group and set this color to the original pixel location (via setting the <code>unsigned char</code> R, G, and B values to  <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code>).
  For this part, the tricky part is to get the index of each "sub" supersampled pixel right.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>
  The barycentric coordinates describe a coordinating system with its x and y axis as the two edge vectors of a triangle. Suppose we have a triangle with vertices a, b, and c. We can construct a coordinate system with vector a -> b and vector a -> c. By this definition, if a point is in the edge of b -> c then the sum of its coordinate must be 1. 

  The barycentric interpolation is a linear combination with the weights of the barycentric coordinate indices and other quantities such as the colors of the vertices on a triangle.

  Below shows two figures of an interpolated triangle and a color wheel.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>
  Given the UV coordinates of the vertices of a triangle, the pixel sampling for texture mapping is to sample colors for the given triangle and map the colors on it.
  The UV coordinates are defined in the texture space. 

  We CANNOT do (1) get the color on the 3 vertices by sample at the texture map and (2) fill the triangle with barycentric interpolated color from the 3 vertices. This is WRONG, since the most of the texture information for this triangle is lost, because on cannot determine the interpolated color is the wanted texture.

  Instead, the sampling procedure is performed in the texture map space. The UV coordinate of the sample point in the triangle should first be interpolated by using barycentric interpolation. Then for this interpolated UV coordinated, it can be sampled on the texture map to get the desired color.

  The process of getting the desired color needs sampling on the (discrete) texture map. For a given (continuous) UV coordinate, a simple way, nearest method, is to find the "nearest" point of the texture map, e.g., UV (element between 0 and 1) -> (400.1, 500.8) (multiplied with the width and height) -> (400, 501). This is simple but can potentially cause "jaggies".
  
  Similar to the ideas of the average filter in the supersampling, one can apply an average filter on the texture map to get a weighted averaged color in the pixel sampling process to achieve more smooth image. Bilinear method is to linearly interpolate the four texel around a given UV coordinate. The corresponding weights are the distance of the four nearest texels' distance w.r.t. the given UV coordinate.

    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task5-n-16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">
          <b>Figure 5c:</b> Nearest sampling. Sample rate = 16.
        </figcaption>
      </td>

        </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  From the above figures, we can see that at a low sample rate, the bilinear method clearly outperforms nearest sampling method reducing the antialiasing effects. At a higher sample rate (e.g., 16), the two methods have smaller difference since the supersampling method already applies a averaging filter on the screen space, making the bilinear method not that distinguishable.
</p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>
  Level sampling is that we store different level of resolution of the textures of an image to the memory first and then selecting the corresponding level based on the size of the sampling area in the texture space (or how much the sampling area across the texture space). If the sampling are is large (i.e., one pixel sampling on large texture area), we may select a low resolution texture and save the computation of applying the average filter. 

  Level sampling needs more memory space to avoid computation for antialiasing. Pixel sampling though needs more computation for antialiasing but less memory space.
